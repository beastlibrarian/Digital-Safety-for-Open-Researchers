# How To Contribute to Digital Safety for Open Researchers

**Thank you for your interest in contributing to Digital Safety for Open Researchers :tada:!**
>We couldn't do this without you, your expertise, and your experiences.

**Our Project Vision**
>Researchers who make their work publicly accessible, especially those from underrepresented or marginalized communities, can come under [vicious personal and professional online attack](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/04/04/590928008/professor-harassment). This can be a real issue for those who research topics the public may define as controversial. Currently, there are few academic institutions proactively working to educate researchers on digital safety, and many researchers are unsure of how to prevent or remedy attacks on their digital privacy. As project leaders, we believe that raising awareness about researchers’ digital safety and privacy is one way help to safeguard intellectual freedom in the digital age. 

>Digital Safety for Open Researchers will produce an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) (OER) for members of the higher education community looking to mitigate digital safety threats while working and teaching open. Digital Safety for Open Researchers will be a living collection of case studies that present tools and practices researchers can learn from as they consider their own digital safety. It will bring together researchers who share their stories and suggest tools and practices based on their experiences.

## What we're working on & how you can help!

We invite collaborators to contribute expertise and stories to our OER. Different skills will be needed to contribute to different portions of our project. Our hope is to have this [GitBook OER](https://digital-safety-for-open-research.gitbook.io/project/) shared and expanded on by other researchers and academic institutions.</br> 

This collaborative, open effort will help us pool our knowledge to create the best possible resource and by working open we will ensure that everyone has equitable access to this resource. 

We could use your help with the following: 

>:arrow_right: **Build out content for modules:** Share your own story about a digital safety problem, Share successful privacy expertise, teaching exercises, or lesson plans relevant to the module topics

>:arrow_right: **Provide expertise on:** digital safety and law, creating good education texts, tools and practices for digital safety

>:arrow_right: **Provide perspectives from various fields:** computer science, communication, journalism, activism, and other relevant fields

## How to report bugs

Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 

Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
